## About The Project

Don't Forget is a simple mobile application created with Flutter. It simply helps you to remember if you did something or not and records the update time. The main purpose of developing this simple app for me is to learn bloc state management with clean architecture and testing in Flutter. You can use it as a base architecture of your projects because it is simple, scalable and maintainable.

### Built With

- [Flutter]([flutter-url])

## Getting Started

Don't Forget is a really simple app so that it's easier to understand what is happening under the hood.
